<p><strong>ADVISOR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Effective as of 23 April 2019</em></strong></p>

<p>PlanPlus Global Inc. designs software for use by subscribing financial services provider&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;Subscriber&rdquo;) financial planners, wealth managers, brokers or other financial advisors (&ldquo;Advisor&rdquo;) to support the Advisor in exercising their professional judgement in providing financial guidance or advice to the Advisor&rsquo;s clients (the &ldquo;Clients&rdquo;). PlanPlus&rsquo;s software is available to Subscribers as an annual subscription service (paid monthly or annually) as presented and offered from-time-to-time at <a href="http://www.planplusglobal.com">www.planplusglobal.com</a>, which includes but is not limited to the SuitabilityPro: FinaMetrica Profiler (&ldquo;Profiler&rdquo;), SuitabilityPro: ProTracker and SuitabilityPro: ProPlanner, which may include a collaborative website portal from which Advisors can interact with their Clients (&ldquo;Client Portal&rdquo;), collectively referred to as the &ldquo;SuitabilityPro Modules&rdquo;. The SuitabilityPro Modules are delivered from the websites <a href="http://www.suitabilitypro.com">www.suitabilitypro.com</a>, <a href="http://www.miplanplus.com">www.miplanplus.com</a> and <a href="http://www.planplusglobal.com">www.planplusglobal.com</a> (&ldquo;Websites&rdquo;). Collectively, the SuitabilityPro Modules, the Client Portal, the Websites, and other services or products offered by PlanPlus on the Websites or elsewhere shall be referred to hereafter as the &ldquo;PlanPlus Global Software&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The SuitabilityPro: FinaMetrica Profiler provides an assessment of a Client&rsquo;s financial risk profile (the &ldquo;Profile&rdquo;), comprising the risk tolerance questionnaire (the &ldquo;Test&rdquo;), a financial experience and knowledge questionnaire and a KYC (know-your-client) questionnaire, all of which can be taken by the Client through the Client Portal, and a Methodology for using the results of the Profile, the Client&rsquo;s Financial Data and Advisor&rsquo;s Planning Assumptions in the financial advising process to provide guidance or advice for a recommended portfolio suitable for the particular Client. The Test statistically compares the Client&rsquo;s risk tolerance answers with the answers of a large sample population of clients to provide Advisors with an objective starting point for Client discussions regarding suitable risk and reward parameters. The Client&rsquo;s Profile, Advisor&rsquo;s Planning Assumptions, client-specific notes taken by the Advisor when engaging with the Client, and Advisor&rsquo;s recommendations, guidance or advice are captured in a Report. The Advisor shares the Report (in person, printed or through the Client Portal) with the Client, which is then reviewed by the Advisor and their Client. If the Subscriber has signed up for the FinaMetrica Profiler, the Websites provide access to and use of the FinaMetrica Profiler.</p>
<p>The SuitabilityPro: ProPlanner provides an assessment of a Client&rsquo;s financial goals, income, assets, liabilities, portfolios and other financial information (&ldquo;Financial Data&rdquo;) and a Methodology for the advisor to use the results of the Client&rsquo;s Financial Data and Advisor&rsquo;s Planning Assumptions (as well as the Profile if the Subscriber has also signed up for the FinaMetrica Profiler) to assist the Advisor in developing a suitable guidance or advice for the Client in the form of a financial plan. The Client&rsquo;s Profile (if also using the Profiler), Financial Data, Advisor&rsquo;s Planning Assumptions, client-specific notes taken by the Advisor when engaging with the Client, and Advisor&rsquo;s recommendations, guidance or advice may be captured in a Report. The Advisor shares the Report (in person, printed or through the Client Portal) with the Client, which is then reviewed by the Advisor and their Client. If the Subscriber has signed up for the ProPlanner, the Websites provide access to and use of the ProPlanner.</p>
<p>The SuitabilityPro: ProTracker provides a Methodology for using the results of the Client&rsquo;s Financial Data and/or the Profile and an Advisor&rsquo;s Planning Assumptions in the financial advising process to monitor the Client&rsquo;s Financial Data over time and provide mechanisms to verify and notify the Advisor and/or Client if the Advisor&rsquo;s recommendations or plan are on-track through automated monitoring of some or all of the Client&rsquo;s Financial Data, the prices of financial products provided by third party vendors, and/or other relevant information provided by the Advisor or the Advisor&rsquo;s back-office systems. Advisors can only subscribe to the ProTracker if they are currently Subscribers to either the FinaMetrica Profiler or ProPlanner modules.
